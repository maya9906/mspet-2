                        <p> The Golden Hamster is the most well-known species, found in the Syrian province and is also called the Syrian hamster (Syrinan Hmaster). It is docile and easy to handle and is widely loved as a pet. Golden hamsters are generally classified by the color of the fur, the length of the pattern. The fur color is Sable, Orange, Beige, White, Ivory, Grey, Coffee, Chocolate, Sepia, Black, etc., and Bandid is also common with a pattern that looks like a white belt around the body. Depending on the length of the hair, it is divided into short hair and long hair, especially long-haired males have a longer hair length than females, so they should pay attention to managing their hair.

                            The body length is 15~18cm, which is large among hamsters, so it's not fast and suitable for handling. The tail is as short as 1 cm, and when it becomes an adult, it weighs about 100 to 150 g. Males are smaller and docile than females.
