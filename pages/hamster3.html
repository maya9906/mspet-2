                        <p> It is from Mongolia, China and the Siberian desert. It has only recently become popularized as a pet, and although there are not many people raising it, it is increasing. In Korea, it was called 'deer hamster' at the beginning of its introduction.

                            With a body length of 5 to 7 cm and a weight of 25 to 40 g, it is smaller than other dwarf hamsters. Roboevsky hamsters are small in size and difficult to handle. It has brown hair on the back and no stripes. There is also a white robo-ski that is all white.
                            
                            In rare cases, hamsters live in groups in the wild. Because it is small, timid, and fast, it is believed to have increased the survival rate by quickly escaping through multiple passages when predators invade after a group of people live in the same cave.</p>
